	<!--Preserve Formatting
Sometimes, you want your text to follow the exact format of how it is written in the HTML document.
 In these cases, you can use the preformatted tag <pre>.
Any text between the opening <pre> tag and the closing
 </pre> tag will preserve the formatting of the source document. try without it following-->
      <pre>
         function testFunction( strText ){
            alert (strText)
         }
      </pre>
  
<!--html Attributes-->
      <p align = "left">This is left aligned</p> 
      <p align = "center">This is center aligned</p> 
      <p align = "right">This is right aligned</p> 


<!--Core Attributes
The four core attributes that can be used on the majority of HTML elements (although not all) are −

id  - To Uniquely Identifies element
title   -The title attribute gives a suggested title for the element.
            Now try to bring your cursor over "Titled Heading Tag Example" and 
            you will see that whatever title you used in your code is coming out as a 
            tooltip of the cursor.
class   -The class attribute is used to associate an element with a style sheet, and 
            specifies the class of element. 
style   -The style attribute allows you to specify Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) rules
             within the element.   -->

<p id="firstid">This has a id! Shhhhh..</p>
<p title="You are A Champ!">Bring Cursor over Me! I will tell you something!</p>
    
<p style = "font-family:arial; color:rgb(255, 123, 0); font-size: large;">Hey! I Used Style Attribute! Because of that I am looking Beautiful.</p>

<!--Other common HTML attributes:
    align   -Horizontally aligns tags   Values:-    right, left, center
    valign  -Vertically aligns tags within an HTML element. Values:-    top, middle, bottom
    bgcolor
-->


<!--
        Grouping Content
                The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group together several elements to create
                sections or subsections of a page.
-->

        <div id = "menu" align = "middle" >
            <a href = "">Home</a> | 
            <a href = "https://www.google.com/">Google</a> | 
            <a href = "https://www.w3schools.com/html">W3schools</a>
        </div>

        <div id = "content" align = "left" >
            <h5>Content Articles</h5>
            <p>Actual content goes here.....</p>
         </div>

<!--
    The <span> element, on the other hand, can be used to group inline elements only.
     So, if you have a part of a sentence or paragraph which you want to group together, 
     you could use the <span> element as follows.-->

        <p>This is the example of <span style = "color:green">span tag</span>
            and the <span style = "color:red">div tag</span> alongwith CSS</p>
<br/>


<!--Text Abbreviation
You can abbreviate a text by putting it inside opening <abbr> and closing </abbr> tags.
 If present, the title attribute must contain this full description and nothing else.-->
            
            <p>My name is  <abbr title = "Akshay Rana">AR</abbr>.</p>

            <p>This chapter covers marking up text in <acronym>XHTML</acronym>.</p>
  <img src="latios.jpg" alt="Latios May Torche" width = "450" height = "300" border = "10" ></img>


  <!--  HTML TABLES
The HTML tables allow web authors to arrange data like text, images, links, other tables,
 etc.
 into rows and columns of cells.

The HTML tables are created using the <table> tag in which the <tr> tag is used to create
     table rows and <td> tag is used to create data cells. The elements under <td> are
          regular and left aligned by default
  -->

<br/><br/>
  <table border = "0">  <!--if 0 then no border-->
    <tr>
       <td>Row 1, Column 1</td>
       <td>Row 1, Column 2</td>
    </tr>
    
    <tr>
       <td>Row 2, Column 1</td>
       <td>Row 2, Column 2</td>
    </tr>
 </table>

 <!--Colspan and Rowspan Attributes
    You will use colspan attribute if you want to merge two or more columns into a 
    single column. Similar way you will use rowspan if you want to merge two or more rows.-->
 
    <table border = "1" background = "latios.jpg">
        <tr>
           <th>Column 1</th>
           <th>Column 2</th>
           <th>Column 3</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
           <td rowspan = "2">Row 1 Cell 1</td>
           <td>Row 1 Cell 2</td>
           <td>Row 1 Cell 3</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
           <td>Row 2 Cell 2</td>
           <td>Row 2 Cell 3</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
           <td colspan = "3">Row 3 Cell 1</td>
        </tr>
     </table>

<!--HTML Lists-
    
    HTML offers web authors three ways for specifying lists of information.
     All lists must contain one or more list elements. Lists may contain −

    <ul> − An unordered list. This will list items using plain bullets.
    <ol> − An ordered list. This will use different schemes of numbers to list your items.
    <dl> − A definition list. This arranges your items in the same way as they are 
        arranged in a dictionary.
    -->

     <ul>
         <li>Beetroot</li>
         <li>Ginger</li>
         <li>Potato</li>
         <li>Radish</li>
      </ul>



      <ol>
        <li>Beetroot</li>
        <li>Ginger</li>
        <li>Potato</li>
        <li>Radish</li>
     </ol>


     <!--
         <ol type = "1"> - Default-Case Numerals.
            <ol type = "I"> - Upper-Case Numerals.
            <ol type = "i"> - Lower-Case Numerals.
            <ol type = "A"> - Upper-Case Letters.
            <ol type = "a"> - Lower-Case Letters.
                
            The start Attribute
You can use start attribute for <ol> tag to specify the starting point of
     numbering you need. Following are the possible options −
            -->


            <!--

                    HTML Definition Lists
                    HTML and XHTML supports a list style which is called definition lists where entries are listed like in a dictionary or encyclopedia. The definition list is the ideal way to present a glossary, list of terms, or other name/value list.

                    Definition List makes use of following three tags.

                    <dl> − Defines the start of the list
                    <dt> − A term
                    <dd> − Term definition
                    </dl> − Defines the end of the list

            -->


            <!--A webpage can contain various links that take you directly to other pages
                 and even specific parts of a given page. These links are known as hyperlinks.
                A link is specified using HTML tag <a>.
                -->

                <p>Click following link</p>
                <a href = "https://www.tutorialspoint.com" target="_self" >Tutorials Point</a>

_blank  -   Opens the linked document in a new window or tab.

_self   -   Opens the linked document in the same frame.

<br/>
<font face = "Comic sans MS" size =" 5">Comic Sans MS</font><br />
     <!--

A visitor will only be able to see your font if they have that font installed 
on their computer. So, it is possible to specify two or more font face alternatives 
by listing the font face names, separated by a comma.
